  by living and growing up in over 10 countries, across continents and cultures, i have over my life time spoken 11 human languages, with at least basic fluency ~ some i have forgotten and still speak 7 human languages
  furthermore, i have coded in ca. 30 languages ~ i could code "anything" in any language
  tip: i have found that to learn a language, one has to simply force oneself to use only that language plus body language ~ beginning with a word, your vocab will increase everyday and you will be fluent within half a year
  also, learn the word "opposite" in your target language, as it basically doubles your vocab (you know a word X, ask a local "opposite X?")

new whitepaper: https://github.com/2i2i/whitepaper

2i2i is the idea that everyone has value

2i2i allows everyone to earn their value in coins

2i2i is market for your time right *now*
you have *something* to offer ~ the value of it is best measured in a market

share your link with the world and allow the world to offer coins for your time
if you like the offer, have a live video meeting

*
on-chain, any coin, private, scalable, zero credit-risk
*

* on-chain: runs on Algorand, super cheap, fast and safe
* any coin: any coin of any economic value or even coins of subjective value (e.g. NFTs) (rm)
* private: your meeting is end-2-end encrypted and peer-2-peer ~ even 2i2i does not see your data
* scalable: peer-2-peer meetings allow for an efficient network
* zero credit-risk: coins are locked in an autonomous (rm) smart contract ~ no one can steal them, not even 2i2i

its the uber of talking ~ giving everyone an income stream

=======
app to be released on Android and iOS
=======


further thoughts:
set the minimum support you want for your time and watch as the world bids higher or lower to show what your measured value is

you similarly can talk with whomever you want and give them support in coins
the more valueable it is for you to talk with them, the more you are willing to offer
there are people in the world that you might love to have a chat with who normally you would not have a chance to chat with
there are people that are extremely busy but have very valuable advice
is it worth for them to be on 2i2i ~ yes, of course, because they can transform their very high value into energy in the form of coins

money is an efficient storage of energy
imagine i expend energy by cleaning someone's garden
in exchange they give me money
then, maybe in ten years, i could exchange that money for someone cleaning my pool
so i exchanged money for energy
i had energy, i gave away energy and exchanged it for money
and then i exchanged my money for energy
and so the money was an as efficient as inflation storage for energy
and so, someone who is very busy but has valuable advice or is just valuable as a person
this person can exchange their value into coins and with those coins they buy whatever they want
point being, since 2i2i is a market, there will be people offering very high amounts for people of very high perceived value
hence, of course such a person is willing to take that ~ imagine a high celebrity ~ would such a person be willing to talk for 1 million USD per hour with a random fan
yes, of course, because they could also just talk for 30 seconds and earn 30/(60*60)*1 million USD = ca. 10'000 USD

everyone earns and helps others earn more
its the uber of talking ~ giving everyone an income stream
the fairest one ~ according to your market

roadmap
rm: currently only ALGO is supported ~ all coins coming soon
rm: currently the smart contract is controlled by 2i2i ~ after it will be controlled by a DAO ~ finally it will be autonomous


history
2i2i was created during a hackathon with encode in 2021 which ended with the first MVP.
2i2i was accepted into the encode accelerator in 2022 which ended in refined testnet dApp.
2i2i has received an Algorand foundation grant and will soon release the mainnet dApp.

the contract written in Lua could be runtime compiled into C and then embedded into our existing C++ Monte Carlo engine.

i had the amazing pleasure of working at the QRC Team at UBS, in Zurich, Switzerland.
the QRC (Quantitative Risk Control) team consisted of the most talented indivuals that I had ever seen.
not only were the team members mostly PhDs in Math or Theoretical Physics, they were Olympiad Medalist winners or similar.
and then there was me.
getting in was an extremely difficult experience. after being told 'no' by HR, I insisted and got an interview.
conducting the first interviews on the phone, I had to solve math problems in my head because I thought it would just be a friendly call. i was wrong.
afterwards, I spent an entire day being asked tough math questions by around 10 people. at the end, HR again rejected me, but the team wanted me.
against all odds, i got the job. i would go on to get a 'record time' promotion, aparently 'unheard of', after less than 6 months at UBS, during the height of the 2009 financial crisis.

i joined a competition called 'Quiz on Korea'. I managed to (barely) win the Swiss national competition.
this made me the Swiss representative at the international 'Quiz on Korea' world championships in Seoul. i did not do well at the finals for weird reasons, but still consider it a success to have made it that far.

moving to North America is always a challenge. for our kids education, we decided to take on this adventure.
we arrived in Canada on the same day that our encode competition started. it was quite tough managing the competition whilst settling into a completely new place.
after getting the visa, arriving, getting a car, a house, i consider this a success.

          in my 2nd year at Humboldt Universität zu Berlin, Prof. Naumann showed us an advanced proof for the uncountability and 0 Lebueque measure of the Cantor set.
          he remarked that he did not know of any elementary proof for this statement and that this was surprising. i took the challenge and produced an elementary proof after 2 months of thinking.
          Prof. Naumann was impressed and decided to co-publish and name the central function used after my name. before publishing, for due diligence, Prof. Naumann checked whether this proof was really novel.
          it was not; the exact same proof had been published in the 1970s and he had just not heard about it before.
          that made my proof not novel but still counts as independent research.

        description: '''
          in my childhood, i have been a victim of 5 kidnapping attempts, 3 of which were successful. i also lived for ca. 6 years as a prisoner.
          in my opinion, i have dealt with it relatively well, despite suffering from almost-life-long depression as a result.
          the kidnappings very familial, but unfortunately no less dramatic or traumatising. events included strangers, criminality, continents, conspiracy and drama.
          my life as a prisoner, as it turns out, was entirely in my head though. the experience was geniune and full of fear, but in actuality, i just 'never' talked and it was assumed that my environment was voluntary.
          i thought of running to freedom or telling someone everyday for a few years and less in the last years.
          none the less, though too quietly, I have still lived a good enough life after finding freedom.
          one of the worst consequences has been the fact that up until ca. my 40th birth anniversary, i have been ashamed of my ability of coding ~ i have been coding since a very young age and always felt like i could code "anything" using any language ~ but, i was always ashamed of this skill and hid it as much as possible ~ finally, i asked my wife 'is it weird to be ashamed of being good with computers?' ~ crazy!

after receiving lots of positive feedback, i recognised impostor syndrome ~ i went to a hypnosist to make my mind 'super humanly confident, just shy of irrational' ~ 
it worked extremely well and i have lost all humility since ~ i now openly and actively tell about my strengths ~ and also weaknesses ~ i always do my best to be precise and not exagerate
